# 🎵 Spotify Music Intelligence Platform

A sophisticated machine learning-powered application that goes beyond simple metadata to recommend music based on **audio features** (energy, valence, danceability, etc.).

## 🚀 Features

### 1. **Enhanced Mood-Based Discovery** 😃😢⚡🥳💪☕
Don't know what to listen to? Choose a mood, and the AI will find tracks that match that emotional curve.
- **Happy**: High valence, high energy.
- **Melancholic**: Low valence, slower tempo.
- **Energetic**: High tempo, high energy.
- **Focus**: Low acousticness, consistent rhythm.
- **Party**: High danceability and positive energy.
- **Workout**: Highest energy and high BPM (>120).
- **Chill**: Low energy, high acousticness/instrumentalness.

### 2. **Vibe Builder & Preference Profiles** 🎛️💾
Fine-tune your recommendations with precision and save your favorite settings:
- **Audio Control**: Set specific levels for **Danceability**, **Energy**, **Acousticness**, **Instrumentalness**, and **Valence**.
- **Save Profiles**: Save your current vibe as a named profile (e.g., "Deep Study" or "Midnight Drive").
- **Quick Load**: Instantly switch between your saved profiles to update your discovery settings.

### 3. **Smart Playlist Management** 🎵➕
- **Direct Add**: Add any recommended track to your existing playlists with a single click.
- **Auto-Generate**: Create entire playlists based on a single seed track or a specific mood.
- **Personal Library**: Manage your musical discoveries easily from the Playlists tab.

### 4. **Genre Classification AI** 🧠
- Implements an **XGBoost Classifier** trained on **89,000+ tracks** (125 genres).
- Predicts genres based solely on audio features with confidence scores.

### 5. **Personal Listening Analytics** 📊🎧
Discover your musical DNA with detailed insights into your listening habits:
- **Audio DNA**: Visualizes your average audio features (energy, danceability, etc.) across all track plays.
- **Genre Distribution**: See your top genres at a glance.
- **Interactive History**: Tracks every session and provides real-time updates to your dashboard.

### 6. **BPM-Phased Workout Generator** 🏃‍♂️🔥
Generate playlists that match the physical intensity of your workouts:
- **Intensity Arc**: Sequenced from **Warm-up** (low-mid BPM) to **Peak** (high energy) and **Cool-down**.
- **Custom Duration**: Set your target time from 15 to 90 minutes.
- **Phase Visuals**: Tracks are color-coded by workout phase for easy navigation.

### 7. **Genre Analytics Dashboard** 📈🔍
Deep dive into the characteristics of 125 different musical genres:
- **Genre DNA**: Every genre has a dedicated analytics dashboard visualizing its unique audio profile (Energy, Danceability, etc.).
- **Market Insights**: Integrated data on average track popularity and top artists within each genre.
- **Top Artist Discovery**: Identify the most representative artists for any given genre.

### 8. **User Accounts & Security** 🔐
- **Auth**: JWT-based authentication for secure personal sessions.
- **Persistence**: All playlists, history, tracks, and preference profiles are saved to a SQLAlchemy-managed database.

## 💻 Installation & Setup

### 1. Prepare the dataset
The application expects the CSV files under the **top‑level `data/` folder**. By default the repository contains two files:

- `data/dataset.csv` – the raw Spotify export
- `data/cleaned_dataset.csv` – generated by running the cleaner script

If `cleaned_dataset.csv` is missing you can create it with:

```bash
python backend/clean_data.py
```

This step is performed automatically by `run_services.py` (see below).

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Running the API
There are two supported modes:

1. **Monolithic** (all endpoints in a single app):
   ```bash
   python main.py          # serves at http://localhost:8000
   ```

2. **Microservices** (split into auth/recommender/analytics/playlist):
   the helper script will start all four and generate the dataset if needed:
   ```bash
   python run_services.py  # ports 8001–8004
   ```

The frontend chooses which URLs to call based on environment variables; by default it will hit the monolith at `http://localhost:8000` unless you set `REACT_APP_AUTH_SERVICE`, `REACT_APP_RECOMMENDER_SERVICE`, etc.

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 4. Running with Docker (optional)
The repository includes Dockerfiles for each micro‑service and a `docker-compose.yml` that spins up all
services plus a PostgreSQL container.

Before starting the stack you need to build the shared base image and make sure the
`data/` folder (containing `cleaned_dataset.csv`) and `.env` file are available. The compose file mounts
them into the containers.

```bash
# build base image used by all services
docker build -t spotify-base -f backend/Dockerfile.base backend

# start the whole architecture
docker-compose up --build
```

The `docker-compose.yml` also supports an `env_file` entry, so your `backend/.env` will be loaded
automatically; you can still override individual variables via the usual `-e` flags.

Once the containers are running the frontend will be served on http://localhost (port 80) and the
APIs on ports 8001–8004.  Be sure the dataset is present or the recommender will still return
empty results despite the services being up.

To stop the stack press **Ctrl‑C** (or `docker-compose down`).
